> 
> **TEST PAGE OBJECT CLASS**
A Page Class/Object is an object-oriented class that serves as an representation of a page in your application. The test class then use the methods of these page classes whenever they need to interact with the UI of that screen. The benefit is that if the UI changes, the tests themselves donâ€™t need to change, only the code within the Page Class. Subsequently all changes to support the new UI are located in one place.
